<strong>TRACK YOUR CODING.</strong> 
<strong>REAL-TIME.</strong> 
<strong> AUTOMATIC.</strong> 
<p>Codealike remembers everything you do on the code, so you don't have to.</p> 
<p>It integrates to your IDE and browser while automatically tracks and analyzes your activity.</p> 
<br> 
<strong>You and your team get the benefits.</strong> 
<strong>Here are some of +15&nbsp;<em>(jaw-dropping)</em>&nbsp;features.</strong> 
<br> 
<strong>Focus &amp; Interruptions</strong> 
<p><span>Do you want to understand how your concentration grows and how interruptions affect it? This is the feature for you. Codealike shows you your "Focus Curve" but it also shows you how many interruptions you had during different periods of time. This is handy to show clearly how much effort it takes to recover from undesired interruptions.</span></p>

<strong>Timeline</strong> 
<p><span>This feature shows you the ADN of your work. It rebuilds your day by showing you the precise sequence of activity that you did so you can drilldown and explore every segment of time to understand what you did.</span></p>

<strong>Code Tree</strong> 
<p><span>Shows you the amount of time you spend Editing, Reading, Debugging and Building on different code solutions and projects. But why should we stop there? You'll be able to drilldown all the way through Namespaces, Files, Classes, Methods and Members. Use this report to see code's contributors and technical debt.</span></p>
